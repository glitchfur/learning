# Learning

This is my experimentation and self-learning repo where I try to make all my mistakes so I don't make them on real projects.

There is nothing to see here but countless hours wasted correcting one-character typos, pain, suffering, angry commit messages, and probably lots of red X symbols in GitHub Actions.

The data here has no significance. It is literally junk, and it can be added or removed at any time.

This repo is public so that I can point people to errors I've made and then they can either share my pain or humiliate me. If you _do_ happen to gain anything from this repo, it better be learning from my mistakes so you don't make them yourself.
